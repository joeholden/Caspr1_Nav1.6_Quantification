# Caspr1_Nav1.6_Quantification

This program quantifies IHC-based histology for Caspr1 and NaV 1.6. 
It quantifies the following parameters:
  Perinode length (Caspr1)
  Node Length (Nav 1.6)
  Caspr Intensity
  Nav 1.6 Intensity
  Nodal Shift 

Images were taken with 100X confocal but the program should work at lower resolutions and on any decent microscope
